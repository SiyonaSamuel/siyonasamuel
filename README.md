## Hello there, my name is Siyona! 👋 
I'm a graduate student at Columbia University in the Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) program. 

### My research interests span the following broad topics: 
- Inequality specifically those stemming from racial and caste-based discrimination
- Poverty and experimental designs of poverty alleviation studies
- Socio-economic factors that impede on development specifically gender-based consequences

### What I'm currently working on (December 2021): 
'Go West, Young Firm' is a paper by Professor Jorge Guzman at Columbia Business School. I'm currently working with Prof. Guzman on the analysis portion of the paper. We are in the process of collecting and sorting new data for an improved experiment design to conclude results with higher confidence.
